    DESCRIPTION
    This function computes the R-squared and marginal R-squared from
    estimated factors and factor loadings.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INPUTS
               Fhat    = estimated factors (one factor per column)
               lamhat  = factor loadings (one factor loading per column)
               ve2     = eigenvalues of covariance matrix
               series  = series names

     OUTPUTS
               R2      = R-squared for each series for each factor
               mR2     = marginal R-squared for each series for each factor
               mR2_F   = marginal R-squared for each factor
               R2_T    = total variation explained by all factors
               t10_s   = top 10 series that load most heavily on each factor
               t10_mR2 = marginal R-squared corresponding to top 10 series
                         that load most heavily on each factor
